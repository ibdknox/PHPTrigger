            <ul style="display:none;"><li>Use the simplest tomato sauce you can find. This means either getting something like the plain flavored Ragu sauce (I highly recommend this as a good starting base) or plain tomato sauce out of a can. If you use the canned tomato sauce, though, I would add some olive oil to the mix to give it a bit of richness.</li><li>Always heat your sauce. If you don't believe me that it makes a difference, try this sometime: put a little sauce in a pan and heat it up for about 5 minutes, now pour a little cold sauce in next to it. Notice how differently colored they are? There's a reason for that... you're releasing the flavor in the sauce.</li><li>If you're making spaghetti with meat sauce (Bolognese) cook the meat (I use ground turkey, personally) with a couple cloves of garlic and about half an onion diced. I really like to use red onion (red sauce, red onion right?), but yellow would work just as well.</li><li>If you're not making meat sauce, saute some onion and some garlic together anyway, and then add your tomato sauce to the pan.</li><li>One of the best things you can do to really make your spaghetti pop is to use red pepper flakes. Now, before you get worried, you don't have to put in enough that you actually make it hot (although that's really good), just enough that you get some of the pepper flavor in the sauce. Black pepper is useful here too, but if you're making a red sauce, you absolutely should have some red in there - it's a very different flavor.</li><li>Given that most italian dishes are tomato, cream, or wine based, why not add all of them to your sauce? I add a bit of red wine to my sauce to give it a deeper flavor (color too!) and I put some sour cream in my sauce (a spoonfull or two) to add richness to it. Do both, you won't regret it.</li><li>Balsamic vinegar is all the rage these days - and for good reason. It has a unique flavor, and I add a little bit to my sauce to infuse some of that nuance that is so powerfully linked with italian food. The key here is "a little bit."</li><li>Everyone knows parmesan is usually put over the pasta at the end, but put a little bit in your sauce and let it dissolve away completely - it'll help you use a little less salt (season salt is best) and further add to the rich feel.</li><li>Basil basil basil. People tend to put a ton of oregano in their sauce, but I think if they put less in and substituted some of it for basil they would find they have a much more balanced flavor. Oregano has a very powerful taste and can easily take over the sauce from its more subtle ingredients. Basil on the other hand, is much milder and adds more of that earthiness we look for from the Italian herbs.</li><li>Cumin is, indeed, a great addition to a spaghetti sauce. You have to be really careful not to use too much though, or it will end up tasting too earthy; almost like chili.</li><li>Paprika is your friend... it has a very fruity taste to it and will round out some of the acid in the sauce. Only a little though, otherwise it will end up tasting very odd (try it in a small sample some time).</li><li>Cinammon and nutmeg are cool, but if you really want to go for the gold, give allspice a try. It will add even more dimension to those two and keep people guessing how you got such a complex flavor into your dish. Just a dash.</li><li>Last but not least, once your pasta is done cooking (give whole-wheat a try sometime, it's a nice change) let it simmer in the pan with the sauce for a minute or two, get it good and covered. Having both components with a little heat under them will help them come together better in the end.</li></ul>
